- Hi, I’m @sixwi (Jed Elkins)
- I’m interested in Front End and mobile app development.
- I’m currently learning JavaScript and brushing up on HTML/CSS since Ive not used it in years.
- I’m not looking to collaborate yet because I'm still learning, unless there's something I could work on just to learn.
- How to reach me... coming soon
